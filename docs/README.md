# Aaron's Tools Blog

This blog is for two primary sorts of posting:

1. Thoughts about programming
2. Specific ideas, specifications and projects

In the former case, I'm just brainstorming out loud, but there are times
when my goal is more concrete. Sometimes those ideas involve
[solving a puzzle](posts/ackermann-challenge.html) and sometimes they're
[specifications or outlines for things that don't yet
exist](posts/your-regex-here.html).

Either way, I hope you enjoy!

\- Aaron
