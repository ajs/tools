=item term

Terms are any literal such as numbers and strings. In special circumstances
(operators whose parameters are identifiers) an identifier can serve
as a term. For example:

	my Dog $spot;
	$spot.breed(::beagle);

In the above, Dog, breed and beagle are all examples of identifiers as terms,
all of which are allowed because the my, () and :: operators allow for
identifier parameters.

=item ...

... is the "yada" operator. It indicates unspecified code, and when executes,
produces a runtime error. This is a helpful operator in many places, most
especially in subroutine and method construction. A block whose body is
the yada operator is a "stub". A class whose (non-auto-generated) methods are
all stubs is called "virtual", and cannot be instantiated directly. A role
whose methods are all stubs is called and "interface".

 for *$list -> ($item) { ... } # placeholder code
 sub unittest() { ... } # Subroutine stub to be defined later
 role Canine { # All canines must provide a bark and a bite
   method bark() { ... }
   method bite() { ... }
 }

=item .

Method invocation is performed with the . operator.

 $a.b($c); # invoke $a's b method with parameter $c

=item ()

Used with an identifier as RHS, invokes the named subroutine.

Used with a variable, indexing operation or parenthetical expression,
invokes a subroutine based on either the name or subroutine reference
returned by the resulting value of the RHS.
