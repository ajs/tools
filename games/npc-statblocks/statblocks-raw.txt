(perfect) Melee corrupting touch +2 (3d6, Fort DC 13 half) special attacks sneak attack +1d6 TaCTiCs During Combat Captain Kinkarian attacks only in response to being attacked himself. In such a case, he sees his tormenters as his crew, and curses and froths at them for turning against him, issuing accusations of “Mutineer!” and “Traitor!” as he claws with his hook-handed corrupting touch. Faced with a woman who bears a passing resemblance to his lost love Aeshamara (any red-haired female human, elf, or half-elf), the ghost becomes fascinated and tearfully reaches toward that PC, whispering, “Aeshamara... is that you? Have you come for me?” The ghost remains fascinated for 1 round, after which he can he make a DC 20 Will save as a full-round action to recover from the fascination. Presenting the golden locket to him can also fascinate him in this manner. If anything attacks him, the fascination immediately ends. When he recovers from the fascination, he focuses his wrath on the woman he mistook for his love, shrieking, “No... No! You are not her! Damnable harpy!” If his enemies flee, Captain Kinkarian pursues until he loses sight of the sea, at which point he shrieks and returns to the surf to brood. Morale Captain Kinkarian fights until he’s destroyed, but even then he merely rejuvenates back on the Brine Demon in 2d4 days. If the PCs have taken his locket for their own, he seeks them out again, following the lure of the locket unerringly—even across the ocean. In order to put Captain Kinkarian to rest, someone must forcefully present the open locket containing Aeshamara’s image to the ghost so that he can see the image of the woman inside. This action causes the ghost to break off his attacks and reach for the locket—as soon as he touches it, his incorporeal form fades with a melancholy sigh as he finally meets his true death. sTaTisTiCs str —, Dex 13, Con —, int 12, Wis 8, Cha 14 Base atk +1; CMB +2; CMD 14 Feats Alertness, Iron Will, Persuasive skills Climb +6, Diplomacy +10, Fly +9, Intimidate +10, Knowledge (geography) +7, Knowledge (nature) +7, Perception +15, Profession (sailor) +5, Sense Motive +7, Stealth +9, Swim +6 Languages Common, Polyglot sQ trapfinding +1 sPECiaL aBiLiTiEs sea-Bound (su) Captain Kinkarian’s ghost often appears to walk on water.

Morale Pezock attempts to flee if reduced to 10 hit points or fewer.

During Combat Malikadna prefers to avoid melee combat, instead using her spells and hexes to support the cannibals in a fight. If confronted on her own, she tries to use hideous laughter or cause fear to minimize attacks, but as soon as she takes damage, she uses her wand of vampiric touch to damage foes and heal her own damage. Morale Malikadna fights to the death. sTaTisTiCs str 5, Dex 9, Con 10, int 20, Wis 16, Cha 12 Base atk +2; CMB –1; CMD 8 Feats Brew Potion, Great Fortitude, Toughness skills Acrobatics +4, Bluff +5, Heal +10, Intimidate +8, Knowledge (arcana) +12, Knowledge (religion) +9, Perception +7, Sense Motive +5, Spellcraft +12 Languages Abyssal, Aklo, Common, Infernal, Polyglot, Sylvan sQ witch’s familiar (monkey named Thaltaki) Combat Gear wand of vampiric touch (8 charges); Other Gear quarterstaff sPECiaL aBiLiTiEs Cackle (su) As a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, Malikadna can cackle madly. Any creature within 30 feet that is under the effects of her evil eye or misfortune hex has the duration of that effect extended by 1 round. Evil Eye (su) As a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, Malikadna can use the evil eye to cause a visible foe within 30 feet to take a –2 penalty on one of the following (Malikadna’s choice): AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. This effect lasts for 8 rounds. A DC 17 Will save reduces this duration to 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. Misfortune (su) As a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, Malikadna can cause a creature within 30 feet to suffer grave misfortune for 1 round. Anytime the creature makes an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse result. A DC 17 Will save negates this effect. A single creature cannot be targeted by this ability more than once per day. Witch’s Familiar A witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Instead of a spellbook, Malikadna must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. A witch’s familiar otherwise functions like the wizard’s arcane bond class feature.

Klorak is somewhat obsessed with blood, especially since one of Malikadna’s many lies to him was that the blood of his enemies can increase his virility. The round after he first damages a foe, he attempts a touch attack (this action provokes an attack of opportunity and forces him to drop or sheath his scimitar) to gather the foe’s blood on his palm so he can smear the blood across his chest and face, rolling his eyes and howling maniacally as he does so. He does this the same every round after he drops a foe into negative hit points. This tactic should help to make Klorak a memorable foe against the PCs as well as to give them a  few moments of respite against the powerful enemy—if you find that the PCs are having little problem handling the dangerous barbarian, feel free to omit this behavior.

The target must make a DC 12 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d6 rounds from this effect. Anyone who becomes sickened from this effect is also exposed to filth fever (DC 12 Fortitude save negates). The save DC is Charisma-based. Feed (su) When a festrog inflicts bite damage on a living creature, the festrog feeds on the flesh and gains 5 temporary hit points. Four-Footed Run (Ex) If a festrog doesn’t hold or carry anything in its hands, it can run on all fours. This increases its speed to 50 ft. Festrogs gain Run as a bonus feat.
Treasure: Yarzoth abandoned Captain Kovack to these caverns, leaving him to be transformed into a lacedon (see area V22). Unfortunately for Kovack, the dominate person effect wore off before he completed his transformation into a lacedon. Weakened considerably by the illness and unable to escape through the guardian undead, Kovack spent his last several hours in mind-shattering guilt as memories of what he had done haunted him. He knew he was doomed, but in an attempt to find some form of absolution, he scrawled his confession on a strip of leather armor, using his own blood and a splinter 
 of bone as a pen. This confession is presented as Handout #2.

It charges the smallest target, attempting to pounce and then pin its foe so it can chupar (although if it’s surrounded by foes, it certainly won’t use this tactic). The creature is quite agile, and against larger numbers of foes it uses Flyby Attack and Acrobatics to swoop in, attack, and deny attacks of opportunity. If it can, it tries to lure victims away from allies so it can pounce and feed. Morale The chupacabra fights until it is reduced to 25 hit points or fewer before retreating to its nest.

As long as this soul focus remains intact, it can be built into another doll for the soul to animate, using the same cost as for creating a new construct. Once bound into the soul focus, the soul continues to learn, and so if later put into a new doll body, the soul retains its personality and memories. Regardless of its construction, a soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a Break DC of 20. Poison (Ex) The dolls’ daggers are constantly poisoned with venom as long as the dolls exist and wield them (Medium spider venom—injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Str, cure 1 save).
Treasure: The ruby gems inside of each doll’s chest are worth 2,000 gp apiece, but as they contain the bound souls of creatures (even if said souls are irredeemably evil), selling the gems may cause some PCs concern. The gems themselves radiate moderate necromancy, and can be identified as soulbound doll soul foci with a DC 29 Spellcraft check. You should allow characters who don’t want to sell these gems for profit to donate them to a society or religion that will see to their proper destruction (thus freeing the evil souls) to gain a 2,000 gp reward from that organization. Alternatively, if the PCs take it upon themselves to destroy the gems and free the souls, give the party 800 XP as a reward.

If she dominates a PC, she orders that character to come to her side and defend her from harm. While the dominated PC and skeletons keep the other PCs busy, Yarzoth casts blur and then mirror image. Next she uses summon monster II to summon 1d3 fiendish vipers, then summon monster I to summon one more. When combat finally seems inevitable, she casts divine favor and then attacks. She uses inspiring word on herself or allies if they seem to be having a particularly hard time hitting the PCs, and touch of evil on PCs that seem to be hitting her or her allies easily. Morale If Yarzoth is reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, she touches the lips on the statue of Zura with a bloodied hand and gains the benefit of gaseous form. She then flees up through the hole in the ceiling to area Z9. Once there, she dismisses the effect, returning to solid form. The next round she casts disguise self to assume the form of one of the Jenivere’s other castaways (preferably a woman, either Aerys or Sasha), and on the third round she uses major image to create an illusion of her dead body, throat cut, lying on the floor. Yarzoth hopes that if she can get these deceptions in place by the time the PCs arrive, they’ll be confronted with the unexpected appearance of an old friend who seems to have just killed the evil serpentfolk. (If all of the castaways are actually with the PCs when Yarzoth fled, she of course disguises herself as someone else.) Yarzoth cries out for help if the PCs don’t arrive soon—but also takes the chance to cast healing spells on herself as well. If the PCs fall for the deception, Yarzoth explains that they can exit the inner sanctum by smearing blood on the image of Zura there—she hopes that the PCs will unwittingly take her under their wing and help her escape to the mainland. Of course, by now she also realizes that she’s underestimated the PCs, and she remains ready to attack the instant they see through her trickery. This time, if she’s reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, she turns gaseous again and attempts to flee the complex altogether via the vents in the roof of area Z7—if she escapes in this manner, she goes into hiding in the jungle and stalks the PCs, hoping to strike at them again to get back her research if she can. In this case, you can use Yarzoth as a recurring villain as you see fit. sTaTisTiCs str 12, Dex 23, Con 17, int 16, Wis 20, Cha 18 Base atk +8; CMB +9; CMD 26 Feats Combat Casting, Command Undead, Dodge, Scribe Scroll, Weapon Finesse skills Acrobatics +11, Bluff +9, Disguise +9, Escape Artist +14, Knowledge (arcana) +11, Knowledge (history) +11, Knowledge (religion) +11, Linguistics +10, Perception +13, Sense Motive +13, Spellcraft +11, Swim +9, Use Magic Device +13; Racial Modifiers  +8 Escape Artist, +4 Use Magic Device Languages Aklo, Azlanti, Common, Draconic, Halfling, Polyglot, Undercommon, Varisian; telepathy 100 ft.

Existing webs, while they remain sticky and tangled, do not have this slowing effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

She uses a scroll of shield as soon as she can once she fears combat will begin. During Combat Natalya uses charm person on non-spellcasters, and grease on beams or ladders leading to her position to prevent anyone from reaching her in melee. She prefers fighting at range with her crossbow and acid splash, but if forced into melee combat relies on her magically increased AC to protect her as she moves around to try to get into positions where she can use sneak attack. If she’s confronted by two or more foes in melee, or if she’s reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, she uses the Shard of Pride to create a major image of her shooting flames out of the shard to light the room on fire—she takes care to not put any PC directly in the flames, but puts up illusory fire between herself and any enemies. Morale Natalya’s megalomania prevents her from fleeing or surrendering. If the PCs wish to take her alive, they’ll need to keep that in mind and use appropriate tactics on her.

The thugs hope to run off the PCs and the others, forcing them to abandon the coffin so they can haul it and the body downriver to the Harrowstone memorial (area O, see page 63), where they burn the coffin and the body in the hope of dispersing the “curse” on the town.

TACTICS During Combat Vesorianna hopes the PCs will aid her, and only attacks in self-defense—if the PCs do attack her, she mistakenly sees them as the same guards who locked her in this room 50 years ago. Shrieking in rage and reverting back to the hours before her death, she claws and bites at the PCs, inadvertently assaulting them with her corrupting touch. Morale Vesorianna cannot pursue foes beyond the confines of this room, but fights until destroyed otherwise.

If she is destroyed by the Splatter Man, she returns in 2d4 days as normal, but at that point 
she is the only haunt left in Harrowstone, and the only way to bring her peace at this point is to bring peace to her husband’s ghost by defeating the Whispering Way’s plot to craft a Carrion Crown (a task that the PCs can accomplish at the end of this campaign).

He attempts to keep as many victims wounded and bleeding as possible, since he can only gain 1d6 points of healing per bleeding victim.

These wounds cause 1d6 bleed—any damage 
caused by this bleed effect heals the Lopper of an equal amount of damage as the blood running from the wound turns to smoke and drifts over to the Lopper’s body to merge with his form, provided that the bleeding victim is within 30 feet of the Lopper. Hit points gained in excess of his maximum are lost. Create Spawn (Su) Creatures slain by the Lopper become ectoplasmic undead 1d4 rounds after death, with draining blood forming the bulk of the new undead’s body. Ectoplasmic undead created in this manner are under the Lopper’s command; if the Lopper is destroyed, the ectoplasmic undead become free-willed. Decapitation (Su) A creature slain by the Lopper’s incorporeal touch is always decapitated. The resulting gout of blood created by this grisly triumph heals the Lopper of 2d6 points of damage. fear of fire (ex) Although the Lopper is normally immune to fear effects as a result of his undead state, he remembers the terror of the great fire vividly. If he is successfully damaged by any fire-based attack, he is staggered for 1 round.

He begins combat by attempting to maintain ranged superiority, moving through the various walls of the cells to force the PCs to constantly be on the move to keep up with him. He starts by casting his empowered summon monster II spell to summon 1d3+1 dire rats to serve as distractions, then follows that up with magic missiles (working down from maximized to empowered to normal versions of the spell)—he’ll generally split up his magic missiles among different targets rather than focusing fire on one foe, in a cruel attempt to prolong and distribute the suffering. Once his summoned rats are gone, he’ll use summon monster II to begin summoning giant spiders or octopuses to vex the PCs as appropriate. The Splatter Man’s corrupting touch is one of his most powerful attacks, but he saves it to use against foes who seem to be able to significantly damage him—while he’s a ghost, old habits die hard, and he tends to try to avoid getting into melee confrontations. The Splatter Man is bound to this room—he cannot leave area u11 to pursue foes, but he certainly attempts to use his dream whisper ability on the PCs later if they flee a battle against him, for now that he has firsthand knowledge of the PCs, they gain no bonuses to resist that ability. Morale The Splatter Man fights until destroyed. STATISTICS Str —, Dex 13, Con —, Int 20, Wis 14, Cha 17 Base Atk +4; CMB +5; CMD 18 feats Brew Potion, Combat Casting, Empower Spell, Maximize Spell, Scribe Scroll, Skill Focus (Linguistics), Spell Mastery (comprehend languages, dispel magic, levitate, magic missile, summon monster II) Skills Bluff +11, Diplomacy +11, Fly +9, Intimidate +14, Knowledge (arcana) +16, Knowledge (planes) +16, Linguistics +19, Perception +10, Sense Motive +13, Spellcraft +16, Stealth +12 Languages Abyssal, Aklo, Auran, Azlanti, Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Halfling, Orc, Osiriani, Thassilonian, Varisian SQ arcane bond (familiar—none currently) SPeCIAL ABILITIeS Dream Whisper (Su) The Splatter Man cannot physically leave area u11, but he can extend his consciousness outside of this area to touch the dreams of sleeping mortals once every 1d4+2 nights. This allows the Splatter Man to send visions and hideous dreams to a single sleeping creature within a mile. The target can resist these dreams with a DC 17 Will save; otherwise, the target is affected by the dreams as if by a nightmare spell (the victim gains the same Will save modifiers as afforded to those who are targeted by an actual nightmare, meaning that once the Splatter Man has firsthand knowledge of a creature after it fails the Will save, he tends to stick to that target on successive nights). The second time a target fails to resist the effects of the Splatter Man’s dream whisper, the Splatter Man can, instead of 
causing 1d10 points of damage with the nightmare effect, implant a suggestion in the dreaming creature’s mind. If the suggestion is successful, the creature immediately rises in a somnambulistic state to carry out the commands of the suggestion, which must be something the victim can accomplish before sunrise, at which point the sleepwaking victim wakens with no memory of the dream or his actions while under the influence. If the Splatter Man manages to escape Harrowstone, this ability increases in power, becoming a full-fledged ghostly malevolence ability.
Treasure: The Splatter Man confiscated Warden Hawkran’s magical gear when the prisoners seized control of the prison, hurling the items into the oubliette for safe keeping (and to torment Hawkran, of course). These items remain at the bottom of the flooded oubliette still, under 30 feet of water with the corporeal remains of the Splatter Man himself. These objects were technically unclaimed as belongings by the Splatter Man when he died, and as a result he didn’t form a strong enough spiritual and emotional attachment to them to be able to manifest ghostly duplicates of the gear for him to use. Still, if he expends all of his spells, using his hand of the apprentice ability with some of the items could make an excellent last-ditch tactic. The items themselves consist of a +1 keen longsword, a +1 mithral dagger, and a ring of protection +1.

A chymickal zombie must inject itself with this elixir at least once per week. Failure to do so results in the loss of 1d4 points of Intelligence per week. This Intelligence loss is permanent and cannot be restored, but further Intelligence loss can be prevented with a new injection of the elixir. Once the chymickal zombie’s Intelligence reaches 0, it loses all of its chymickal zombie abilities and becomes a normal zombie in all ways.
