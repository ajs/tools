TACTICS
During Combat Caggan fights with his fists and thrown
pottery from the bar unless attacked with lethal
weapons, at which point he pulls out his warhammer.
Morale Caggan’s not going to give up his life over a unfair
decree that will hopefully be only temporary. As a result,
he surrenders if reduced to 13 hit points or fewer.
