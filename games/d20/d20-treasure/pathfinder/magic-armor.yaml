# This table is the first consulted for magic armor. It is a fucking pain
# in the ass, because it can determine that a special ability is to be
# generated BEFORE you know what kind of armor it is. This gets to be
# a MAJOR pain when you deal with psionic armor which has a different
# sub-lookup for armor abilities and shield abilities (and you don't
# know which one you're rolling on until you finish rolling on this
# one). The solution is to generate placeholders here and then go back
# and generate the final abilities once you've determined what type
# of armor you're dealing with.
