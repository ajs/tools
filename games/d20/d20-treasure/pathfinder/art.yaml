# The art selection is done first by price, and then a name is randomly
# selected. Note that there is no such thing as "minor art", the
# only difference between CR1 art loot and CR20 art loot is how many
# items the treasure-by-cr table will call for.
# Unlike most files, the prices in this file are strings that must be
# parsed. They are in adb*c format where a, b and c are integers with
# a representing the number of dice, b representing the number of sides
# on the dice and c being a multiplier.
