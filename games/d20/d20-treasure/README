With few exceptions, this directory contains YAML files which contain
one of two formats of data. Both are lookup tables for randomly rolled
values. The first looks like this:

---
- num
- value
- num
- value
...

where num is either -1 or a number between 1 and 100. When loaded,
a random number between 1 and 100 will be generated, and the first
pair in the list whose "num" is greater than or equal to the number
selected will be selected. That pair's value is then returned.

Values can either be a string or a hash/dictionary of name/value
pairs.

The second form looks like this:

---
-
  -
    - n
    - m
    - ...
  - value
  -
    - n
    - m
    - ...
  - value

Where n, m, etc. (typically there are three) are numbers similar to
num, in the example above. Typically, these are used for minor (0),
medium (1) and major (2) items or attributes where the percentile
numbers change depending on how powerful the item being generated
is.

As a special case, values can also come in a third form, which is an
embeded selection structure like so:


---
- 10
-
  - 10
  - value1
  - 20
  - value2
  - ...
- 20
- value3
- ...

The embeded structure can be of either the first or second form, but
MUST match the form of the enclosing structure.

Values that represent items are always a hash/dictionary form that
contain the following required (and optional) fields, but
MAY contain any other field names:

name: name of item
type: item type such as ring
price: price in (potentially fractional) gold pieces
subtype: optional subtype such as shield for the armor type

Here's a real example:

---
-
  -
    - 10
    - 6
    - 3
  - name: bane
    special: bane
    plus: 1
  -
    - 17
    - 12
    - -1
  - name: defending
    plus: 1
    type: melee

These are the first two entries from the special weapons table.
